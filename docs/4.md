# 4 Fundamental Data Types

## 4.1 Introduction to fundamental data types
A binary digit, or a bit, is the smallest unit of memory which can hold a 0 or 1. Memory is organized into sequential units called memory addresses. Each memory address holds 1 byte of data. A byte is a group of bits that are operated on as a unit. The modern standard is that a byte is composed of 8 sequential bits. (Some older or non-standard machines might have bytes of a different size, but it's not something that you typically have to worry about with modern programming).
Data types tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way.
Fundamental data types are the types for which C++ comes with built-in support.
Note: integral means "like an integer" and is often used as part of the term `integral type`, which includes all the Boolean, characters, enumerated, and integer types. They are so named because they're stored in memory as integers, even though their behaviors might vary. This is distinct from the term `integer`, which is a specific data type that holds non-fractional numbers, such as whole numbers, 0, and negative whole numbers.
Strings are not a fundamental type in C++, but rather a compound type.

## 4.2 Void
Void means no type. Usually see in the context of a function that does not have a return type.

## 4.3 Object sizes and the sizeof operator
An object with n bits can hold 2^n unique values.
C++ only guarantees that each fundamental data type will have a minimum size. However, the actual size of the variables may be different on your machine. Don't assume that variables are larger than the specified minimum size. Objects of fundamental data types are generally extremely fast.
`sizeof` is a unary operator that takes a type or variable and returns its size in bytes.
Types that use less memory are not necessarily faster than types that use more memory. For example, CPUs are often optimized to process data of a certain size most quickly.

## 4.4 Signed integers
Four different fundamental integer types: short int, int, long int, long long int.
Integers are signed by default. Prefer `short s;` over `short int s;` because it makes it harder to make a mistake if you accidentally miss the `short` keyword (doesn't blend in with the `int` type).
Range of a signed number is [-2^(n-1), 2^(n-1) - 1].
Integer overflow happens when we try to store a value that is outside the range of the type. Signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior. Generally results in a loss of information.
In C++, division with two integers always produces an integer result. Any fractional portion is dropped, not rounded.

## 4.5 Unsigned integers, and why to avoid them
Unsigned integers can only hold non-negative whole numbers. The range for unsigned integers is [0, 2^n - 1]. Unsigned integers are good for systems with little memory.
Unsigned integer overflow results in wraparound behavior.
Don't use unsigned with signed integers.
