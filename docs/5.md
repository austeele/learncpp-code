# 5 Operators

## 5.1 Operator precedence and associativity
C++ has 17 precedence levels. Some precedence levels are left-to-right, others are right-to-left associativity (which means, given adjacent operators in the same precedence level, what is the order in which they resolve?). Consult a chart if uncertain, or just default to using parentheses for clarity. Expressions with a single assignment operator do not need to have the right operand of the assignment wrapped in parentheses.
Assume that parts of an expression could evaluate in any order, outside of the operator precedence and associativity rules.

## 5.2 Arithmetic operators
2 unary arithmetic operators (+,-) and 5 binary (+,-,*,/,%), 6 arithmetic assignment (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=).

## 5.3 Modulus and Exponentiation
Modulus operator % will find the remainder only with integer operands. Use to test if a number is evenly divisible by another number. % also works with negative numbers and always returns results with the sign of x in x%y.
C++ does not have an exponentiation operator; instead #include the cmath header and use the    `std::pow()` function. You have to write your own function if you want to do integer exponentiation, but it will often overflow the integral type, which is why it wasn't included in the standard library in the first place.

## 5.4 Increment/decrement operators, and side effects
