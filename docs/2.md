# 2 C++ Basics: Functions and Files

## 2.1 Introduction to functions
A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
A function call is an expression that tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. Caller is the function initiating the function call, and the callee is the function being called.
Functions are useful because they can be repeatedly called.
Functions can functions that call functions... and so on.
Nested functions are not supported, meaning that functions cannot be defined inside of other functions.
Aside: `foo` is a metasyntactic variable, which essentially means a placeholder name.

## 2.2 Function returning values (value-returning functions)
