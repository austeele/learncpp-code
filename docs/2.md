# 2 C++ Basics: Functions and Files

## 2.1 Introduction to functions
A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
A function call is an expression that tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. Caller is the function initiating the function call, and the callee is the function being called.
Functions are useful because they can be repeatedly called.
Functions can functions that call functions... and so on.
Nested functions are not supported, meaning that functions cannot be defined inside of other functions.
Aside: `foo` is a metasyntactic variable, which essentially means a placeholder name.

## 2.2 Function returning values (value-returning functions)
Function must specify the type to be returned, then return the value with a return statement. When the return statement is executed, the function exits immediately. This is called return by value.
C++ has three defined status codes: 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, and EXIT_FAILURE.
C++ disallows calling the `main` function explicitly. Also define main at the bottom of the code file.
Undefined behavior if a value-returning function doesn't actually return a value.
Main will implicitly return 0 if no return statement is provided, but best practice is to return 0 anyway for consistency with other functions.
Functions can only return a single value.
Best practice is to document what the return value means, since it can be anything.
Good programming practice: DRY (don't repeat yourself)... which is the opposite of WET (write everything twice!)

## 2.3 Void functions (non-value returning functions)
Void means a function does not return a value to the caller.
Void functions do not need a return statement. They can if they want, but it's best practice to avoid adding a return statement to reduce redundancy.
Void functions can't be used in expressions that require a value (for example, when writing output to std::cout).
Void functions are called for their behavior, not their return value. Kind of like buying a car.
Returning a value fronm a void function is a compile error.
A return statement that is not the last statement in a function is called an early return. Early returns can be used in value-returning functions, too.

## 2.4 Introduction to function parameters and arguments
Function parameters are variables used in a function. They are always initialized with a value provided by the caller of the function.
An argument is a value passed from the caller to the function when a function call is made.
When a function is called, parameters of the function are created as variables, and the value of each of the arguments is copied into the matching parameter. This is called pass by value.
The argument passed to a function can be any valid expression.
