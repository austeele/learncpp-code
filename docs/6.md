# 6 Scope, Duration, and Linkage

## 6.1 Compound statements (blocks)
A compound statement, or a block or block statement, is a group of zero or more statements that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement. Blocks can be nested inside other blocks, although functions can't be nested inside other functions. A common use for blocks is in conjunction with if statements. The nesting level or depth is the maximum number of nested blocks you can be inside at any point in the function, including the outer block. Keep the nesting level to 3 or less for readability. Anything longer should be refactored into a function.

## 6.2 User-defined namespaces and the scope resolution
