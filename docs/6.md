# 6 Scope, Duration, and Linkage

## 6.1 Compound statements (blocks)
A compound statement, or a block or block statement, is a group of zero or more statements that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement. Blocks can be nested inside other blocks, although functions can't be nested inside other functions. A common use for blocks is in conjunction with if statements. The nesting level or depth is the maximum number of nested blocks you can be inside at any point in the function, including the outer block. Keep the nesting level to 3 or less for readability. Anything longer should be refactored into a function.

## 6.2 User-defined namespaces and the scope resolution
The `namespace` keyword allows you to declare your own user-defined namespaces so that function definitions don't collide.
Scope resolution operator: `::` allows you to look for an identifier in a particular namespace.
Using the scope resolution operator in front of an identifier without providing a namespace name will look for the identifier in the global namespace; for example, `::doSomething();`. This is useful when we're inside another namespace, but want to call the global version of the function.
Namespaces can be nested, and we can call them like `foo::goo::add()`, if goo is nested inside foo.
Can alias namespaces: `namespace active = foo::goo;`
Use namespaces when you write libraries or code that you want to distribute to others.
