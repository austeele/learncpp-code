# 1 C++ Basics

## 1.1 Statements and the structure of a program
- Statements are like sentences and end in semicolon.
- Every C++ program must have a main function or it will fail to link

## 1.2 Comments
- Two styles of comments in C++:
    - // - single-line comment
    - /* */ - multiline comment
- Good comments:
    - Top of file: describe what the program/function/library/etc does
    - Within/throughout file: how the code accomplishes its goal
    - Statement level: why code is doing something. Don't say what it's doing at this level.

## 1.3 Introduction to objects and variables
- RAM is a series of addressed mailboxes where we can put data. All computers have RAM/memory.
- In C++, access memory indirectly through an object.
    - Object: region of memory with storage and some properties.
    - Named object is a variable, name of the object is identifier
    - In C++, a function is not an object (although it's different in some other programming languages)
- Variable instantiation
    - Variable is instantiated during runtime
    - Instantiation: object created and assigned a memory address
- Data types
    - Integer: number that can be written without a fractional component, like 1, 0, -1, 209, etc
    - In C++, type of variable must be known at compile time

## 1.4 Variable assignment and initialization
- Variable assignment
    - Ex: `int width; width = 5;` - the = in the second statement is copy assignment
    - = is the assignment operator
- Initialization: surprisingly complex in C++, but here is a simple view of the types:
    - `int a; // Default initialization, which in most cases, leaves a variable with an indeterminate value`
    - `int b = 5; // Copy initialization, inherited from C. Copies value on right into left-hand side. Not used much in modern C++.`
    - `int c(6); // Direct initialization. Initially introduced to allow for more efficient initialization of complex objects with class types, but not used much in modern C++ anymore, with one exception we'll cover later`
    - `int d {7}; // Brace/uniform/list initialization. Prefer this. Introduced to provide a more consistent way of initializing objects. Comes in three forms:`
        - `int width {5}; // direct brace initialization of value 5 into variable width (preferred)`
        - `int height = {6}; // copy brace initialization of value 6 into variable height`
        - `int depth {}; // value initialization (see next section)`
        - Note that brace initialization disallows narrowing conversions, so for example, this will create a compile error: `int width {4.5};`
- Value initialization
    - In most cases, initializes variable to zero or empty
- Initialize your variables upon creation

## 1.5 Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl
- Use preprocessor directive `#include <iostream>`
- `std::cout << "Hello, World"!` allows us to print text to console. << is the insertion operator, and it can be chained.
- `std::endl` tells cursor to move to next line (prints a newline character); however, it can be inefficient because it also flushes the output (ensures any cached output shows up on the screen immediately). So for this reason, usually prefer `\n`, which moves cursor to next line without a flush.
- `std::cin` reads input from keyboard with the extraction operator >>. Input must be stored in a variable to be used. Ex: `std::cin >> x;`
- Disambiguation:
    - `std::cout` is used with the insertion operator `<<`, as in `std::cout << x;`. Data from variable x is being printed to the console.
    - `std::cin` is used with the extraction operator `>>`, as in `std::cin >> x;`. Data from variable x is being moved from the keyboard into variable x.
    - Note that `std::cout` and `std::cin` are always on the left.

## 1.6 Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior
- C++ does not initialize variables to given value automatically. Default is garbage value.
- Symptoms of undefined behavior issue:
    - Produces different results each time it's run
    - Consistently produces same incorrect result
    - Inconsistency
    - Crashing
    - Works on some compilers but not others
    - Works until you change a seemingly unrelated part of the code
- Avoid any case that causes undefined behavior, such as using an uninitialized variable

## 1.7 Keywords and naming identifiers
- 92 reserved keywords
- Identifiers in C++ can only start with a letter or underscore, not a number. But otherwise, if not used as the first character, numbers are ok in identifiers. Also, identifiers are case-sensitive.
- Modern best practice for function and variable names is camelCase or separated_by_underscore, and they should start with lowercase letter (like the standard library, or main).
- Identifier names that start with a capital letter are usually reserved for user-defined types like classes, structs, and enums
- Identifier names starting with an underscore typically reserved for OS, library, or compiler use
- Make length of variable name proportional to how widely it's used
- Avoid abbreviations

## 1.8 Whitespace and basic formatting
- C++ compiler generally ignores whitespaces, except in quoted text and single-line comments
    - Quote text separated by nothing by whitespace are concatenated
- Accuracy and readability are important in formatting
- Max line length should be something like 80 characters (use a column guide)

## 1.9 Introduction to literals and operators
- Literal is a fixed value inserted directly into the code, like the `5` in `int x { 5 };`
